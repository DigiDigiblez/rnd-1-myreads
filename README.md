# MyReads app

#### Introduction
Manage your own personal library of books. You can even search for new books to add to your library!

This app was built using atomic design principles and is mobile-first :). 

In addition, going to any route other than "/" and "/search" will hit a 404, securing the user experience, and transporting the user back to the list page.

### Coding style & conventions
This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
The style config files have been trialed and tested so sticking to them makes for great conventions and best practices throughout the code.

For IDEs like WebStorm and PyCharm, you can go to `Preferences | Tools | File Watchers` and add automatic watchers for ESLint and Prettier on any files you choose. Upon pressing save the watchers will auto-lint your changes for ease of use.

### Getting Started
#### Setup Front End
This app uses `Yarn` as it's package manager. Navigate to the frontend directory and use `yarn` to install the dependencies in the `package.json` file. This will generate a `yarn.lock` file. It's advisable to commit this file as and when it is updated.

Once the dependencies are installed, run `yarn start` to run the front end on `port 3000`.
